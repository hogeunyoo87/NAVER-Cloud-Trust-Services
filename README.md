Trust Services Corp.\'s Certification Practice Statement.

### 1.3.2 Registration Authorities

The Registration Authorities (RA) are entities that approve and perform
requests to issue, renew, reissue, and revoke subscriber certificates.
The RAs identify and authenticate the individuals or entities requesting
certificates and validate the submitted application information.

All the RA functions will be performed by NAVER Cloud Trust Services and
none will be delegated to third parties.

### 1.3.3 Subscribers

A subscriber is an end user of a certificate issued by the CAs capable
of using, and authorized to use, the private key that corresponds to the
public key listed in a certificate.

A subscriber is an individual or entity that has end-user certificates
issued by NAVER Cloud Trust Services CA. If NAVER Cloud Trust Services
approves the issuance of certificates according to the procedures in
Section 3.2 Initial Identity Validation of this document, individuals
and entities outside of Korea may also become subscribers. To use
certificates, all the subscribers are required to consent to the
subscriber responsibilities and obligations specified in the \"SSL
Agreement\" before issuing certificates.

### 1.3.4 Relying Parties

A relying party is any individual or entity that verifies a digital
signature with a certificate issued by NAVER Cloud Trust Services or
decrypts an encrypted document or a message.

### 1.3.5 Other Participants

## 1.4 Certificate Usage

### 1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Uses

Certificates issued pursuant to this CP/CPS may be used for all legal
authentication, encryption, access control, and digital signature
purposes, as designated by the key usage and extended key usage fields
found within the certificate.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Uses

Certificates do not guarantee that the Subject is trustworthy, honest,
reputable in its business dealings, compliant with any laws, or safe to
do business with. A certificate only establishes that the information in
the certificate was verified as reasonably correct when the certificate
issued.

Certificates issued under this CP/CPS may not be used (i) for any
application requiring fail safe performance such as (a) the operation of
nuclear power facilities, (b) air traffic control systems, (c) aircraft
navigation systems, (d)weapons control systems, or (e) any other system
whose failure could lead to injury, death or environmental damage; or
(ii) where prohibited by law.

Additionally, Certificates issued under this CP/CPS may not be used for
"traffic management" or man-in-the middle purposes.

## 1.5 Policy Administration

## 2.4 Access Controls on Repositories

The Repository is publicly available. NAVER Cloud Trust Services
operates physical and logical security controls to protect the
repository from unauthorized modification or deletion.

# 3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

## 3.1 Naming

### 3.1.1 Type of Names

NAVER Cloud Trust Services issues Certificates with non-null subject
DNs. The constituent elements of the subject DN conform to ITU X.500.

Domain Validation Subscriber Certificates contain a distinguished name
in the Subject name field, and incorporate the following attributes:

\- CN=common name

Organization Validation Subscriber Certificates contain a distinguished
name in the Subject name field, and incorporate the following
attributes:

\- CN=common name

\- O=organization name

\- L=locality

\- ST=state or province

\- C=country code

NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not issue pseudonymous Certificates as
Section 3.1.3 of this CP/CPS.

### 3.1.2 Need for Names to be Meaningful

NAVER Cloud Trust Services puts meaningful names in both the subjectDN
and the issuerDN fields of Certificates.

### 3.1.3. Anonymity or Pseudonymity of Subscribers

NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not issue anonymous or pseudonymous
Certificates.

### 3.1.4 Rules for Interpreting Various Name Forms

Distinguished Names in Certificates are interpreted using X.500
standards and ASN.1 syntax.

### 3.1.5 Uniqueness of Name

NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not, in general, enforce uniqueness of
subject names. However, name uniqueness is enforced through the domain
name system controlled by ICANN and that any FQDN in a Common Name must
appear in a Subject Alternative Name in the certificate that has been
verified in accordance with section 3.2.2.4. Also, the serial numbers
assigned to certificates are unique, and generated serial numbers are
not reused.

### 3.1.6 Recognition, Authentication, and Role of Trademarks

Subscribers may not request certificates with content that infringes on
the intellectual property rights of another entity. Unless otherwise
specifically stated in this CP/CPS, NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not
verify an Applicant's right to use a trademark and does not resolve
trademark disputes. NAVER Cloud Trust Services may reject any
application or require revocation of any certificate that is part of a
trademark dispute.

## 3.2 Initial Identity Validation

### 3.2.1 Method to Prove Possession of Private Key

A certificate applicant normally proves the ownership of his/her private
key by providing a PKCS#10-formatted Certificate Signing Request, or a
cryptographically equivalent proof to NAVER Cloud Trust Services.

### 3.2.2 Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity

NAVER Cloud Trust Services identifies and validates the applicant and
all the persons, objects, and domains specified in a certificate under
the following circumstances:

-   During the certificate application process

-   During the certificate reissuance process

The appropriate validation of an applicant\'s proxy is performed to
ensure the right to request revocation within the scope required by this
CP/CPS. All subject information to be contained in a certificate shall
conform to the requirements of this CP/CPS and be validated in
accordance with the procedures in this CP/CPS. Such verification process
is intended for:

-   Identifying the applicant requesting a certificate; or

-   Confirming the existence and identity of the subject; or

-   Confirming the physical location of the subject (the business
    presence in the physical address); or

-   Confirming the ownership (or exclusive right) of the domain name to
    be included in a certificate; or

-   Confirming whether the applicant is authorized to request a
    certificate.

### 3.2.2.1 Identity

For Organization Validation Subscriber Certificate, NAVER Cloud Trust
Services verify the identity and address of the Applicant using
documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one
of the following:

1.  A Government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal
    creation, existence, or recognition;

2.  A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a
    Reliable Data Source;

3.  A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent
    for the CA; or

4.  An Attestation Letter.

Alternatively, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may verify the address of the
Applicant (but not the identity of the Applicant) using a utility bill,
bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document,
or other form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable.

Generally, the certificate application is submitted online. When an
applicant completes and submits an online form on the official website,
NAVER Cloud Trust Services verifies:

-   The identity of the organization and applicant representative; and
-   The address of the organization

 | **Identity/Address**   | **Details** |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Organization Identity** | 1. The applicant or application representative submits information that can be proved to NAVER Cloud Trust Services (Ex: Business License, Government-issued tax document).<br>2. Inquiry and verification of information submitted by the applicant or applicant representative in a reliable third-party database.<br>3. Verification of organization and applicant representative identity by contacting through the information submitted by the applicant or applicant representative and contact information verified in a reliable third-party database. |
| **Applicant Representative Identity** | 4. Fill out and submit the applicant representative's name, contact information, and institutional affiliation before or during the certificate application.<br>5. While proceeding with the 3rd process of Organization Identity above, identity verification including applicant representative's employment status and representative qualification. |
| **Organization Address** | Only verified address information can be contained as geographical properties in the Subject field of the Organization Validation Subscriber Certificate. The information submitted by the applicant is compared and verified with a reliable third-party database. If there is an international standard or an official government standard for addresses, it will be followed first.<br><br>**The general criteria for NAVER Cloud Trust Services to determine the address included in the certificate subject properties are as follows:**<br>• **Country Name (C):** Using a two-letter country code according to ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2.<br>• **State or Province (ST):** Using the subdivision name where the subdivision category is in State or Province according to ISO 3166-2, and not to be abbreviated.<br>• **Locality or City (L):** The Locality field is the official English name of the city or town. |

Under special circumstances, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may also verify
the identity of the organization and applicant representative through a
site visit and face-to-face method.

### 3.2.2.2 DBA/Trade name

subjectAltName of type DNS-ID, NAVER Cloud Trust Services shall refuse
the issuance if the wildcard character occurs in the first label
position to the left of a "registry-controlled" label or "public suffix"
(e.g. "\*.com", "\*.co.kr"). NAVER Cloud Trust Services refers to the
\"public suffix list\" of http://publicsuffix.org/ (PSL) as the judgment
criterion, and periodically checks and reflects PSL updates.

### 3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy and Validity Periods

All data sources are evaluated for reliability, accuracy, and for their
protection from alteration and falsification before they are used for
I&A purposes.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not issue individually validated
Certificates to natural persons.

### 3.2.4 Non-verified Subscriber Information {#non-verified-subscriber-information-1}

Only verified information is contained in certificates. Optional
subfields in the subject of an SSL Certificate must either contain
information verified by NAVER Cloud Trust Services or be left empty.

### 3.2.5 Validation of Authority

If the Applicant for a Certificate containing Subject Identity
Information is an organization, NAVER Cloud Trust Services uses a
Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the
Applicant Representative's certificate request. NAVER Cloud Trust
Services uses the sources listed in section 3.2.2.1 to verify the
Reliable Method of Communication.

The authority of Applicant Representatives to request Certificates on
behalf of organizations is verified during the validation of the
Applicant Representative's identity.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services only accepts Certificate requests from
individuals verified through reliable methods of communication. Among
verified individuals, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may only accept
Certificate requests from individuals with written designation by the
Applicant to request for Certificates. In cases that the Applicants want
a list of its authorized Certificate requesters or wish to update that
list, Applicants may request, which may be electronic.

### 3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation

Trust Services CA as the Subject are listed in the Repository, provided
that NAVER Cloud Trust Services has arranged for or accepted the
establishment of the trust relationship.

## 3.3 Identification and Authentication for Re-Key Requests

For re-key requests, NAVER Cloud Trust Services CA and RAs will conduct
the same validation procedures as in Section 3.2 Initial Identity
Validation.

### 3.3.1 Identification and Authentication for Routine Re-Key

See Section 3.2.2

### 3.3.2 Identification and Authentication for Re-Key After Revocation

See Section 3.2.2

## 3.4 Identification and Authentication for Revocation Request

NAVER Cloud Trust Services or the RA authenticates and identifies all
certificate revocation requests made at the Subscriber\'s request. If
identification and authentication procedures are required, NAVER Cloud
Trust Services selects these procedures based on the circumstances of
the request and follows a documented process.

Identification and authentication are not required in cases where the
revocation request is made by NAVER Cloud Trust Services or where the
request is made by reference to a revocation reason that is independent
of the requester\'s identity.

# 4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## 4.1 Certificate Application

### 4.1.1 Who Can Submit a Certificate Application

Applicants will fulfill and submit the DV and OV Certificate application
forms for NAVER Cloud Trust Services.

A revoked certificate suspected of phishing or fraud or a rejected
certificate request is stored in a database operated within NAVER Cloud
Trust Services. NAVER Cloud Trust Services can use such information to
identify suspicious certificate requests.

In the case where the CA and the Subscriber are affiliated, Terms of Use
applicable to the requested SSL/TLS Certificate is acknowledged and
agreed to by an authorized applicant representative. An applicant
representative is a natural person who is either the applicant, employed
by the applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to
represent the applicant, and who has authority on behalf of the
applicant to acknowledge and agree to the Terms of Use.

### 4.1.2 Enrollment Process and Responsibilities

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, all end entity subscribers shall
submit following documentation:

1.  A certificate request, which may be electronic; and

2.  An agreement to Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, which may be
    electronic

NAVER Cloud Trust Services obtain any additional documentation to
determine necessary to meet these requirements.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, NAVER Cloud Trust Services
obtain from the Applicant a certificate request in a form prescribed by
NAVER Cloud Trust Services and that complies with these requirements.
One certificate request may suffice for multiple Certificates to be
issued to the same Applicant provided that each Certificate is supported
by a valid, current certificate request signed by the appropriate
Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. The certificate
request may be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

The certificate request contains a request from, or on behalf of, the
Applicant for the issuance of a Certificate, and a certification by, or
on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained
therein is correct.

## 4.2 Certificate Application Processing

NAVER Cloud Trust Services CA and RAs validate the accuracy of the
information provided by an applicant. If an applicant directly submits a
public key, the applicant can present the public key manually to NAVER
Cloud Trust Services CA and RAs in the form of a PKCS#10 Certificate
Signing Request (CSR).

### 4.2.1 Performing Identification and Authentication Functions

The RAs perform the identification and authentication of the information
submitted by a subscriber as specified in Section 3.2 of this document.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services may request additional information to a
subscriber in accordance with separate verification procedures for High
Risk Certificate Requests.

### 4.2.2 Approval or Rejection of Certificate Applications

Once all the required subscriber information has been validated, NAVER
Cloud Trust Services will approve the certificate request. However, if
the subscriber information is not validated or if the request does not
comply with the CP/CPS requirements, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may
reject the certificate request.

Certificate applications that contain a new gTLD are not approved while
the gTLD is still under consideration by ICANN.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not issue Certificates for Internal
Names or Reserved IP Addresses.

### 4.2.3 Time to Process Certificate Applications

If the subscriber application and identification documents are processed
normally, NAVER Cloud Trust Services will issue the certificate within a
reasonable period of time after the certificate request.

### 4.2.4 Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) Records

NAVER Cloud Trust Services checks for a CAA record for each dNSName in
the subjectAltName extension of the Certificate to be issued, according
to the procedure in RFC 8659, following the processing instructions set
down in RFC 8659 for any records found.

The following Issuer Domain Names in CAA "issue" or "issuewild" records
are recognized as permitting NAVER Cloud Trust Services to issue SSL/TLS
certificate:

-   navercloudtrust.com

NAVER Cloud Trust Services may decide not to check for a CAA record:

-   For certificates for which a Certificate Transparency precertificate
    was created and logged in at least two public logs, and for which
    CAA was checked at time of Precertificate issuance.

-   For certificates issued by a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA
    Certificate as set out in Baseline Requirements section 7.1.2.3 or
    7.1.2.5, where the lack of CAA checking is an explicit contractual
    provision in the contract with the Applicant.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services is permitted to treat a record lookup failure
as permission to issue if:

-   the failure is outside the CA's infrastructure; and

-   the lookup has been retried at least once; and

-   the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the
    ICANN root.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services documents potential issuance that was
prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback to
the CAB Forum on the circumstances.

## 4.3 Certificate Issuance

### 4.3.1 CA Actions During Certificate Issuance

Prior to issuing a Certificate NAVER Cloud Trust Services processes the
Certificate Application and performs the required validation procedures
in accordance with this CP/CPS. Once these procedures have been
completed, the Certificate is generated and the appropriate key usage
extension added.

Prior to signing a Certificate NAVER Cloud Trust Services performs
conformance linting using appropriate tooling. If linting reports a
nonconformity, a report is generated and issuance is halted.

Certificate issuance from a Root CA requires at least two authorized
individuals one of whom deliberately issues a direct command in order to
perform the signing operation.

### 4.3.2 Notifications to Subscriber by the CA of Issuance of Certificate

NAVER Cloud Trust Services notifies Subscriber of the issuance of a
Certificate either via email.

## 4.4 Certificate Acceptance

### 4.4.1 Conduct Constituting Certificate Acceptance

Subscribers are solely responsible for installing the issued certificate
on the subscriber's computer or hardware security module. Certificates
are considered accepted on the earlier of

-   The subscriber's use of the certificate,

-   30 days after the certificate's issuance.

### 4.4.2 Publication of the Certificate by the CA

NAVER Cloud Trust Services publishes the CA certificate in its
repository and publishes end entity certificates by delivering them to
the subscriber using email or an API.

### 4.4.3 Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

NAVER Cloud Trust Services may notify the public of the issuance of a
certificate by adding it to one or more publicly accessible Certificate
Transparency (CT) Logs.

RAs may receive notification of the issuance of certificates they
approve.

not allow temporary suspension or recovery of certificates.

Once a certificate has been revoked, it is marked as revoked by having
its serial number added to the CRL.

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for Revocation

### 4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate

NAVER Cloud Trust Services will revoke a Certificate within 24 hours if
one or more of the following occurs:

1.  The Subscriber requests in writing, without specifying a CRLReason,
    that NAVER Cloud Trust Services revoke the Certificate (CRLReason
    \"unspecified (0)\" which results in no reasonCode extension being
    provided in the CRL);

2.  The Subscriber notifies NAVER Cloud Trust Services that the original
    certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively
    grant authorization (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

3.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services obtains evidence that the Subscriber\'s
    Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate
    suffered a Key Compromise (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise);

4.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services is made aware of a demonstrated or proven
    method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on
    the Public Key in the Certificate (such as a Debian weak key, see
    https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys);) (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise);

5.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services obtains evidence that the validation of
    domain authorization or control for any Fully-Qualified Domain Name
    or IP address in the Certificate should not be relied upon.
    (CRLReason #4, superseded).

NAVER Cloud Trust Services will revoke a Certificate within 5 days and
use the corresponding CRLReason if one or more of the following occurs:

1.  The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of Sections
    6.1.5 and 6.1.6 of the CABF Baseline Requirement (CRLReason #4,
    superseded);

    the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate
    (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

9.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services\'s right to issue Certificates under the
    BR expires or is revoked or terminated, unless NAVER Cloud Trust
    Services has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP
    Repository (CRLReason \"unspecified (0)\" which results in no
    reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);

10. Revocation is required by NAVER Cloud Trust Services\'s CP/CPS for a
    reason that is not otherwise required to be specified by this
    section 4.9.1.1 (CRLReason \"unspecified (0)\" which results in no
    reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL); or

11. NAVER Cloud Trust Services is made aware of a demonstrated or proven
    method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if
    there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate
    the Private Key was flawed (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise).

### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate

    appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate or misleading;

7.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services or Subordinate CA ceases operations for
    any reason and has not made arrangements for another CA to provide
    revocation support for the Certificate;

8.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services\'s or Subordinate CA's right to issue
    Certificates under the Baseline Requirements expires or is revoked
    or terminated, unless NAVER Cloud Trust Services has made
    arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository;

9.  Revocation is required by NAVER Cloud Trust Services's Certification
    Practice Statement; or

10. NAVER Cloud Trust Services will revoke a Cross Certificate if the
    cross-signed entity or Cross Certificate no longer meets the
    Applicable Requirements.

### 4.9.2 Who Can Request Revocation

The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services provides a process for Subscribers to request
revocation of their own Certificates. Subscribers may request revocation
of their own certificate on the following methods:

-   Sending an email to dl_rootca@navercorp.com including sufficient
    detail to identify the specific certificates to be revoked

Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software
Supplier, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports
informing the issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the certificate.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for Revocation Request

NAVER Cloud Trust Services processes a revocation request as follows:

1.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services logs the identity of entity making the
    request or problem report and the reason for requesting revocation.
    NAVER Cloud Trust Services may also include its own reasons for
    revocation in the log.

2.  NAVER Cloud Trust Services may request confirmation of the
    revocation from a known administrator, where applicable, via out of
    band communication (e.g., telephone, fax, etc.).

3.  If the request is authenticated as originating from the Subscriber,
    NAVER Cloud Trust Services revokes the certificate.

4.  For requests from third parties, NAVER Cloud Trust Services
    personnel investigates the request and (if needed) revokes the
    applicable certificate within 24 hours after receipt.

5.  If NAVER Cloud Trust Services determines that revocation is
    appropriate, NAVER Cloud Trust Services personnel revoke the
    certificate and update the CRL.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services maintains a continuous 24x7 ability to accept
and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports. If
appropriate, NAVER Cloud Trust Services forwards complaints to law
enforcement.

Subscriber certificate revocation requests can be submitted to the email
address disclosed in Section 1.5.2.

### 4.9.4 Revocation Request Grace Period

Subscribers are required to request revocation within one day after
detecting the loss or compromise of the Private Key. NAVER Cloud Trust
Services may grant and extend revocation grace period on a case-by-case
basis.

### 4.9.5 Time Within Which CA Must Process the Revocation Request

NAVER Cloud Trust Services begins the procedure for certificate
revocation immediately after the request has been received.

After the certificate revocation, the CAs apply the revocation to the
CRL, and in no case is it later than 24 hours following the revocation.

Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, NAVER
Cloud Trust Services investigates the facts and circumstances related to
the report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the
Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, NAVER Cloud Trust Services
works with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate
Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether
or not the certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date which NAVER
Cloud Trust Services will revoke the certificate. The period from
receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice
to published revocation must not exceed the time frame set forth in
Section 4.9.1.1. The date selected by NAVER Cloud Trust Services will
consider the following criteria:

1.  The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity,
    magnitude, risk of harm);

2.  The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to
    Subscribers and Relying Parties);

3.  The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a
    particular Certificate or Subscriber;

4.  The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law
    enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal
    activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer
    alleging that they didn't receive the goods they ordered);and

5.  Relevant legislation.

### 4.9.6 Revocation Checking Requirements for Relying Parties

Relying Parties are required to confirm the validity of each certificate
in the certificate chain by checking for certificate validity, issuer to
subject name chaining, policy and key use constraints and revocation
status through CRL or OCSP responder before relying on a certificate.

### 4.9.7 CRL Issuance Frequency

NAVER Cloud Trust Services will update and reissue CRLs with a frequency
greater than or equal to that required by the NAVER Cloud Trust Services
CP/CPS.

CRLs are available via a publicly-accessible HTTP URL (i.e.,
\"published\").

Within twenty-four (24) hours of issuing its first Certificate, the CA
will generate and publish either:

> • a full and complete CRL; OR
>
> • partitioned (i.e., \"sharded\") CRLs that, when aggregated,
> represent the equivalent of a full and complete CRL.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services issuing Subscriber Certificates:

> 1\. will update and publish a new CRL at least every:
>
> • seven (7) days if all Certificates include an Authority Information
> Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod ("AIA OCSP pointer");
> or
>
> • four (4) days in all other cases;
>
> 2\. will update and publish a new CRL within twenty-four (24) hours
> after recording a Certificate as revoked.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services issuing CA Certificates:

> 1\. will update and publish a new CRL at least every six (6) months;
>
> 2\. will update and publish a new CRL within twenty-four (24) hours
> after recording a Certificate as revoked.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services will continue issuing CRLs until one of the
following is true:

> 1\. all Subordinate CA Certificates containing the same Subject Public
> Key are expired or revoked; OR
>
> 2\. the corresponding Subordinate CA Private Key is destroyed.

See Section 2.2 for CRL locations.

### 4.9.8 Maximum Latency for CRLs {#maximum-latency-for-crls-1}

The CRL is posted to the CRL repository within an hour following the CRL
generation.

### 4.9.9 On-Line Revocation/Status Checking Availability

The following only applies for communicating the status of Certificates
which include an Authority Information Access extension with an
id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP responses conform to RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019. They are either:

> 1\. Signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation
> status they indicate, or
>
> 2\. Signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA
> that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is indicated. The
> OCSP Responder\'s signing Certificate contains an extension of type
> id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck, as defined by RFC 6960.

### 4.9.10 On-Line Revocation Checking Requirements {#on-line-revocation-checking-requirements-1}

The following only applies for communicating the status of Certificates
which include an Authority Information Access extension with an
id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP responders operated by NAVER Cloud Trust Services SHALL support the
HTTP GET method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates1. OCSP responses have a
validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours; 2. OCSP
responses have a validity interval less than or equal to ten days; 3.
For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, then
the NAVER Cloud Trust Services update the information provided via an
Online Certificate Status Protocol prior to one‐half of the validity
period before the nextUpdate. 4. For OCSP responses with validity
intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, then NAVER Cloud Trust
Services update the information provided via an Online Certificate
Status Protocol at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no
later than four days after the thisUpdate.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: • NAVER Cloud Trust
Services SHALL update information provided via an Online Certificate
Status Protocol i. at least every twelve months; and ii. within 24 hours
after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a certificate
serial number that is "unused", then the responder should not respond
with a "good" status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not
Technically Constrained in line with Section 7.1.5 of the Baseline
Requirements, this CP/CPS, the responder must not respond with a "good"
status for such requests.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services may monitor the OCSP responder for requests
for "unused" serial numbers as part of its security response procedures.

The OCSP responder may provide definitive responses about "reserved"
certificate serial numbers, as if there was a corresponding Certificate
that matches the Precertificate \[RFC6962\]. 1. "assigned" if a
Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA,
using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject; or 2.
"reserved" if a Precertificate \[RFC6962\] with that serial number has
been issued by a. the Issuing CA; or b. a Precertificate Signing
Certificate \[RFC6962\] associated with the Issuing CA; or 3. "unused"
if neither of the previous conditions are met.

### 4.9.11 Other Forms of Revocation Advertisements Available

Not applicable.

### 4.9.12 Special Requirements re Key Compromise

In the case that a private key used for a certificate electronic
signature is damaged, the subscriber must immediately notify NAVER Cloud
Trust Services that the subscriber's certificate has been compromised.

If subscriber\'s key has been compromised or subscriber suspects it has
been compromised, subscriber can and should submit a key compromise
report to NAVER Cloud Trust Services email address:

-   dl_rootca@navercorp.com

A key compromise report must include:

1.  The private key itself and (optionally) the certificate.
2.  A valid email address so that subscriber can receive confirmation of
    the problem report and associated certificate revocations.

In accordance with CP/CPS Section 4.9.1.1, If NAVER Cloud Trust Services
obtains evidence that subscriber\'s private key corresponding to the
public key in the certificate suffered a key compromise, the certificate
will be revoked in time.

## 5.6 Key Changeover

When rolling over a CA, NAVER Cloud Trust Services generates a new Key
Pair and begins using the new certificate. The old CA Private Keys are
still protected, and the old CA certificate is still made available to
verify signatures until all of the certificates signed with the Private
Key expire. Towards the end of a CA Private Key's lifetime, whether due
to expiration or due to unilateral change by NAVER Cloud Trust Services,
NAVER Cloud Trust Services ceases using the expiring CA Private Key to
sign certificates and uses the old Private Key only to sign CRLs and
OCSP responder certificates. At that time, a new CA signing Key Pair is
commissioned. All subsequently issued Certificates and CRLs are signed
with the new private signing key.

Both the old and new Key Pairs may be concurrently active. This key
changeover process helps minimize any adverse effects from CA
Certificate expiration. The new CA Public Key Certificate is provided to
subscribers and relying parties through the delivery methods in Section
6.1.4.

Where a cross-signed CA performs a key rollover, NAVER Cloud Trust
Services obtains a new CA Public Key (PKCS#10) or new CA Certificate
from the other CA and distributes a new CA Cross Certificate as
specified herein.

encoding based upon the signing key used.

If the signing key is P‐256, the signature use ECDSA with SHA‐256. When
encoded, the AlgorithmIdentifier is byte‐for‐byte identical with the
following hex‐encoded bytes: 300a06082a8648ce3d040302.

If the signing key is P‐384, the signature use ECDSA with SHA‐384. When
encoded, the AlgorithmIdentifier is byte‐for‐byte identical with the
following hex‐encoded bytes: 300a06082a8648ce3d040303.

### 7.1.4 Name Forms

#### 7.1.4.1 Issuer Information

For every valid Certification Path (as defined by RFC 5280, Section 6):

• For each Certificate in the Certification Path, the encoded content of
the Issuer Distinguished Name field of a Certificate is byte-for-byte
identical with the encoded form of the Subject Distuished Name field of
the Issuing CA Certificate.

• For each CA Certificate in the Certification Path, the encoded content
of the Subject Distinguished Name field of a Certificate is
byte-for-byte identical among all Certificates whose Subject
Distinguished Names can be compared as equal according to Section 7.1 of
RFC 5280. and including expired and revoked Certificates.

When encoding a Name, NAVER Cloud Trust Services ensures that:

• Each Name contains an RDNSequence.

• Each RelativeDistinguishedName contains exactly one
AttributeTypeAndValue.

• Each RelativeDistinguishedName, if present, is encoded within the
RDNSequence in the order that it appears in Section 7.1.4.2.

• Each Name will not contain more than one instance of a given
AttributeTypeAndValue across all RelativeDistinguishedNames unless
explicitly specified in this document.

#### 7.1.4.2 Subject Information -- Subscriber Certificates

NAVER Cloud Trust Services issues certificates that only include
attributes in the Certificate subject field that are listed in the table
below and encodes those attributes in the relative order as they appear
in the table and follow the specified encoding requirements for the
attribute.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services will not include these attributes unless
their content has been validated as specified by, and only if permitted
by, the relevant certificate profile specified within Section 7.1.2.

By issuing the Certificate, NAVER Cloud Trust Services represents that
it followed the procedure set forth in its Certification Practice
Statement to verify that, as of the Certificate's issuance date, all of
the Subject Information was accurate. NAVER Cloud Trust Services does
not include a Domain Name in a Subject attribute except as specified in
Section 3.2.2.4.

SSL/TLS Certificate can only contain verified information according to
Section 3.2, and does not include unverified information.
subject:organizationName, subject:localityName, and subject:countryName
attributes must be verified in accordance with Section 3.2.2.1.

Subject attributes must not contain only metadata such as \'.\', \'-\',
and \' \' (i.e. space) characters, and/or any other indication that the
value is absent, incomplete, or not applicable.

Wildcard FQDNs are permitted.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services does not issue certificates with a
subjectAlternativeName extension or Subject commonName field containing
a Reserved IP Address or Internal Name.

Entries in the dNSName should be in the \"preferred name syntax\", as
specified in RFC 5280, and thus cannot contain underscore characters
('\_').

#### 7.1.4.3. Subscriber Certificate Common Name Attribute

If present, this attribute contains exactly one entry that is one of the
values contained in the Certificate\'s subjectAltName extension. The
value of the field is encoded as follows:

• If the value is a Fully-Qualified Domain Name or Wildcard Domain Name,
then the value is encoded as a character-for-character copy of the
dNSName entry value from the subjectAltName extension. Specifically, all
Domain Labels of the Fully-Qualified Domain Name or FQDN portion of the
Wildcard Domain Name are encoded as LDH Labels, and P-Labels are not be
converted to their Unicode representation.

#### 7.1.4.4. Other Subject Attributes

When explicitly stated as permitted by the relevant certificate profile
specified within Section 7.1.2, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may include
additional attributes within the AttributeTypeAndValue beyond those
specified in Section 7.1.4.2.

Before including such an attribute, NAVER Cloud Trust Services:

• Documents the attributes within Section 7.1.4 of their relevant CP/CPS
documents, along with the applicable validation practices.

• Ensures that the contents contain information that has been verified
by NAVER Cloud Trust Services, independent of the Applicant.

### 7.1.5 Name Constraints

No stipulation.

### 7.1.6 Certificate Policy Object Identifier

The certificates issued under NAVER Cloud Trust Services use this CP/CPS
as a certificate policy, and the related policy identifiers are
specified below.

-   Domain Validation Subscriber Certificate: 1.2.410.200081.2.2.3.1
-   Organization Validation Subscriber Certificate:
    1.2.410.200081.2.2.3.2

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by
NAVER Cloud Trust Services as an optional means of asserting that a
Certificate complies with these Requirements.

• {joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23)
ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) baseline-requirements(2)
domain-validated(1)} (2.23.140.1.2.1)

• {joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23)
ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) baseline-requirements(2)
organization-validated(2)} (2.23.140.1.2.2)

### 7.1.7 Usage of Policy Constraints Extension

No stipulation

### 7.1.8 Policy Qualifiers Syntax and Semantics

No stipulation

### 7.1.9 Processing Semantics for the Critical Certificate Policies Extension

No stipulation

## 7.2 CRL Profile

All CRLs that NAVER Cloud Trust Services issues comply with the
following CRL profile, which incorporates, and is derived from RFC 5280.
Except as explicitly noted, all normative requirements imposed by RFC
5280 shall apply, in addition to the normative requirements imposed by
this document. NAVER Cloud Trust Services examines RFC 5280, Appendix B
for further issues to be aware of.

A full and complete CRL is a CRL whose scope includes all Certificates
issued by NAVER Cloud Trust Services.

A partitioned CRL (sometimes referred to as a \"sharded CRL\") is a CRL
with a constrained scope, such as all Certificates issued by NAVER Cloud
Trust Services during a certain period of time (\"temporal sharding\").
Aside from the presence of the Issuing Distribution Point extension (OID
2.5.29.28) in partitioned CRLs, both CRL formats are syntactically the
same from the perspective of this profile.

Minimally, NAVER Cloud Trust Services issues either a \"full and
complete\" CRL or a set of \"partitioned\" CRLs which cover the complete
set of Certificates issued by NAVER Cloud Trust Services. In other
words, if issuing only partitioned CRLs, the combined scope of those
CRLs is equivalent to that of a full and complete CRL.

### 7.2.1 Version Number(s) {#version-numbers-2}

Certificate Revocation Lists are of type X.509 v2.

### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL Entry Extensions {#crl-and-crl-entry-extensions-1}

CRLReasons

| **RFC 5280 reasonCode** | **RFC 5280 reasonCode value** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **unspecified**         | 0                            | Represented by the omission of a reasonCode. MUST be omitted if the CRL entry is for a Certificate not technically capable of causing issuance unless the CRL entry is for a Subscriber Certificate subject to these Requirements revoked prior to July 15, 2023. |
| **keyCompromise**       | 1                            | Indicates that it is known or suspected that the Subscriber's Private Key has been compromised. |
| **affiliationChanged**  | 3                            | Indicates that the Subject’s name or other Subject Identity Information in the Certificate has changed, but there is no cause to suspect that the Certificate’s Private Key has been compromised. |
| **superseded**          | 4                            | Indicates that the Certificate is being replaced because: the Subscriber has requested a new Certificate, the CA has reasonable evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any fully‐qualified domain name or IP address in the Certificate should not be relied upon, or the CA has revoked the Certificate for compliance reasons such as the Certificate does not comply with these Baseline Requirements or the CA's CP/CPS. |
| **cessationOfOperation**| 5                            | Indicates that the website with the Certificate is shut down prior to the expiration of the Certificate, or if the Subscriber no longer owns or controls the Domain Name in the Certificate prior to the expiration of the Certificate. |
| **certificateHold**     | 6                            | Not included if the CRL entry is for:<br>1) A Certificate subject to these Requirements, or<br>2) A Certificate not subject to these Requirements and was either:<br>A) Issued on-or-after 2020-09-30 or<br>B) Has a notBefore on-or-after 2020-09-30. |
| **privilegeWithdrawn**  | 9                            | Indicates that there has been a subscriber-side infraction that has not resulted in keyCompromise, such as the Certificate Subscriber provided misleading information in their Certificate Request or has not upheld their material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use. |


Tools that NAVER Cloud Trust Services provides to the Subscriber allow
for these options to be easily specified when the Subscriber requests
revocation of their Certificate, with the default value being that no
revocation reason is provided (i.e. the default corresponds to the
CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension
being provided in the CRL).

The privilegeWithdrawn reasonCode is not available to the Subscriber as
a revocation reason option, because the use of this reasonCode is
determined by NAVER Cloud Trust Services and not the Subscriber.

When NAVER Cloud Trust Services obtains verifiable evidence of Key
Compromise for a Certificate whose CRL entry does not contain a
reasonCode extension or has a reasonCode extension with a
non-keyCompromise reason, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may update the CRL
entry to enter keyCompromise as the CRLReason in the reasonCode
extension. Additionally, NAVER Cloud Trust Services may update the
revocation date in a CRL entry when it is determined that the private
key of the certificate was compromised prior to the revocation date that
is indicated in the CRL entry for that certificate.

#### 7.2.2.1 CRL Issuing Distribution Point

Partitioned CRLs will contain an Issuing Distribution Point extension.
The distributionPoint field of the Issuing Distribution Point extension
MUST be present. Additionally, the fullName field of the
DistributionPointName value will be present, and its value will conform
to the following requirements:

1\. If a Certificate within the scope of the CRL contains a CRL
Distribution Points extension, then at least one of the
uniformResourceIdentifiers in the CRL Distribution Points\'s fullName
field will be included in the fullName field of the CRL\'s Issuing
Distribution Point extension. The encoding of the
uniformResourceIdentifier value in the Issuing Distribution Point
extension is byte-for-byte identical to the encoding used in the
Certificate\'s CRL Distribution Points extension.

2\. Other GeneralNames of type uniformResourceIdentifiermay be included.

3\. Non-uniformResourceIdentifier GeneralName types are not included.

The indirectCRL and onlyContainsAttributeCerts fields are set to FALSE
(i.e., not asserted).

NAVER Cloud Trust Services may set either of the onlyContainsUserCerts
and onlyContainsCACerts fields to TRUE, depending on the scope of the
CRL.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services CRLs do not assert both of the
onlyContainsUserCerts and onlyContainsCACerts fields.

## 7.3 OCSP Profile

NAVER Cloud Trust Services provides an OCSP service for TLS certificates
which conforms to the RFC 6960 standard.

If an OCSP response is for a Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate,
including cross-signed Subordinate CA Certificates, and that certificate
has been revoked, then the revocationReason field within the RevokedInfo
of the CertStatus is present.

The CRLReason indicated contains a value permitted for CRLs, as
specified in Section 7.2.2.

### 7.3.1 Version Number(s) {#version-numbers-3}

No stipulation

### 7.3.2 OCSP Extensions {#ocsp-extensions-1}

The singleExtensions of an OCSP response does not contain the reasonCode
(OID 2.5.29.21) CRL entry extension..

> No stipulation

### 9.6.3 Subscriber Representations and Warranties

NAVER Cloud Trust Services requires, as part of the Subscriber Agreement
or Terms of Use, that the Applicant make the commitments and warranties
in this section for the benefit of the CA and the Certificate
Beneficiaries.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, NAVER Cloud Trust Services
obtain, for the express benefit of the CA and the Certificate
Beneficiaries, either:

1.  The Applicant's agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with NAVER
    Cloud Trust Services, or

2.  The Applicant's acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

NAVER Cloud Trust Services implements a process to ensure that each
Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the
Applicant. In either case, the Agreement apply to the Certificate to be
issued pursuant to the certificate request. NAVER Cloud Trust Services
may use an electronic or \"click-through\" Agreement provided that NAVER
Cloud Trust Services has determined that such agreements are legally
enforceable. A separate Agreement may be used for each certificate
request, or a single Agreement may be used to cover multiple future
certificate requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each
Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by
that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use contain provisions imposing on
the Applicant itself (or made by the Applicant on behalf of its
principal or agent under a subcontractor or hosting service
relationship) the following obligations and warranties:

1.  Accuracy of Information: An obligation and warranty to provide
    accurate and complete information at all times to the CA, both in
    the certificate request and as otherwise requested by the CA in
    connection with the issuance of the Certificate(s) to be supplied by
    the CA;
